Javascript Fundamentals: Introduction to Javascript and jQuery
Workshop Outline
Date:	February 12, 2014	
Time:	7pm - 9pm

==Description==
Participants will be introduced to Javascript as the core programming language of the web, able to add such things as interactivity and animation to web pages, as well as retrieve and parse information to be displayed to a user.
The journey will start with a review of how Javascript implements the core concepts of a programming language by walking participants through a series of examples.
From there, participants will move toward developing an understanding of how, why and when to use a Javascript library, with jQuery as the example.

By the end of the Workshop, participants will be familiar with core programming concepts as they are implemented with Javascript, and the ability to access the DOM with jQuery.
